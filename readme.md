# nft callout chrome extension
as we all know, twitter recently unrolled this feature for users to set nfts as their pfp. i've seen a couple of chrome extensions that auto-block these (such as [this](https://github.com/mcclure/NFTBlocker)), but y'know, the satisfaction of blocking someone manually? anyways, i made this.

## install instructions
- download "nft-callout.zip" from the right under "releases".
- unzip it.
- go to chrome://extensions if you're on a chrome browser. you should be on one? if you're not, this wouldn't work. sorry.
- turn on developer mode (top right)
- choose "load unpacked"
- navigate to this
- yay!

have fun :) if you know css you can even have a go at modifying it slightly.

it's rather bodgy, but hey, it works! at least, it works for me on the newest version of chrome on a mac. i have no idea about other platforms or versions, sorry.

## why mark and not block?
honestly, i just doing this a lot cleaner. and of course the ✨ satisfaction ✨ of blocking manually :)

## how does this work?
it just injects some css into your browser that adds some red and a flag to any profile picture with the hexagon crop.
