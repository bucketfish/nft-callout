# nft callout chrome extension

as we all know, twitter recently unrolled this feature for users to set nfts as their pfp. i've seen a couple of chrome extensions that auto-block these (such as [this](https://github.com/mcclure/NFTBlocker)), but y'know, the satisfaction of blocking someone manually? anyways, i made this.

## install instructions
- download the zip file from the right under "releases".
- unzip it.
- go to [chrome://extensions] if you're on a chrome browser. you should be on one? if you're not, this wouldn't work. sorry.
- turn on developer mode (top right)
- choose "load unpacked"
- navigate to this
- yay!

have fun :) if you know css you can even have a go at modifying it slightly.

it's rather bodgy, but hey, it works!
